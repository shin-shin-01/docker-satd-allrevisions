# This file describes the standard way to build Docker in a container on Windows
# Server 2016 or Windows 10.
#
# Maintainer: @jhowardmsft
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Prerequisites:
# --------------
#
# 1. Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10 with all Windows updates applied. The major 
#    build number must be at least 14393. This can be confirmed, for example, by 
#    running the following from an elevated PowerShell prompt - this sample output 
#    is from a fully up to date machine as at mid-November 2016:
#
#    >> PS C:\> $(gin).WindowsBuildLabEx
#    >> 14393.447.amd64fre.rs1_release_inmarket.161102-0100
#
# 2. Git for Windows (or another git client) must be installed. https://git-scm.com/download/win.
#
# 3. The machine must be configured to run containers. For example, by following
#    the quick start guidance at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start or
#    https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/windows/windows-containers/Setup.md
#
# 4. If building in a Hyper-V VM: For Windows Server 2016 using Windows Server
#    containers as the default option, it is recommended you have at least 1GB 
#    of memory assigned; For Windows 10 where Hyper-V Containers are employed, you
#    should have at least 4GB of memory assigned. Note also, to run Hyper-V 
#    containers in a VM, it is necessary to configure the VM for nested virtualization.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Usage:
# -----
#
#  The following steps should be run from an (elevated*) Windows PowerShell prompt. 
#
#  (*In a default installation of containers on Windows following the quick-start guidance at
#    https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start,
#    the docker.exe client must run elevated to be able to connect to the daemon).
#
# 1. Clone the sources from github.com:
#
#    >>   git clone https://github.com/docker/docker.git C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker
#    >>   Cloning into 'C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker'...
#    >>   remote: Counting objects: 186216, done.
#    >>   remote: Compressing objects: 100% (21/21), done.
#    >>   remote: Total 186216 (delta 5), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 186195
#    >>   Receiving objects: 100% (186216/186216), 104.32 MiB | 8.18 MiB/s, done.
#    >>   Resolving deltas: 100% (123139/123139), done.
#    >>   Checking connectivity... done.
#    >>   Checking out files: 100% (3912/3912), done.
#    >>   PS C:\>
#
#
# 2. Change directory to the cloned docker sources:
#
#    >>   cd C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker 
#
#
# 3. Build a docker image with the components required to build the docker binaries from source
#    by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows .          
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows -m 2GB .    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 4. Build the docker executable binaries by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   docker run --name binaries nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary
#    >>   docker run --name binaries -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 5. Copy the binaries out of the container, replacing HostPath with an appropriate destination 
#    folder on the host system where you want the binaries to be located.
#
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\docker.exe C:\HostPath\docker.exe
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\dockerd.exe C:\HostPath\dockerd.exe
#
#
# 6. (Optional) Remove the interim container holding the built executable binaries:
#
#    >>    docker rm binaries
#
#
# 7. (Optional) Remove the image used for the container in which the executable
#    binaries are build. Tip - it may be useful to keep this image around if you need to
#    build multiple times. Then you can take advantage of the builder cache to have an
#    image which has all the components required to build the binaries already installed.
#
#    >>    docker rmi nativebuildimage
#

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  The validation tests can either run in a container, or directly on the host. To run in a
#  container, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then run one of the
#  following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run --rm nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -DCO -PkgImports -GoFormat
#    >>   docker run --rm -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -DCO -PkgImports -GoFormat    (if using Hyper-V containers)

# To run the validation tests on the host, from the root of the repository, run the
# following from a Windows PowerShell prompt (elevation is not required): (Note Go
# must be installed to run these tests)
#
#    >>   hack\make.ps1 -DCO -PkgImports -GoFormat

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run unit tests, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then run one of
#  the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run --rm nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -TestUnit
#    >>   docker run --rm -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -TestUnit    (if using Hyper-V containers)


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run all tests and binary build, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then 
#  run one of the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -All
#    >>   docker run -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -All    (if using Hyper-V containers)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Important notes:
# ---------------
#
# Don't attempt to use a bind-mount to pass a local directory as the bundles target
# directory. It does not work (golang attempts for follow a mapped folder incorrectly). 
# Instead, use docker cp as per the example.
#
# go.zip is not removed from the image as it is used by the Windows CI servers
# to ensure the host and image are running consistent versions of go.
#
# Nanoserver support is a work in progress. Although the image will build if the 
# FROM statement is updated, it will not work when running autogen through hack\make.ps1. 
# It is suspected that the required GCC utilities (eg gcc, windres, windmc) silently
# quit due to the use of console hooks which are not available.
#
# The docker integration tests do not currently run in a container on Windows, predominantly
# due to Windows not supporting privileged mode, so anything using a volume would fail.
# They (along with the rest of the docker CI suite) can be run using 
# https://github.com/jhowardmsft/docker-w2wCIScripts/blob/master/runCI/Invoke-DockerCI.ps1.

#    the quick start guidance at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start or
#    https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/windows/windows-containers/Setup.md
#
# 4. If building in a Hyper-V VM: For Windows Server 2016 using Windows Server
#    containers as the default option, it is recommended you have at least 1GB 
#    of memory assigned; For Windows 10 where Hyper-V Containers are employed, you
#    should have at least 4GB of memory assigned. Note also, to run Hyper-V 
#    containers in a VM, it is necessary to configure the VM for nested virtualization.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Usage:
# -----
#
#  The following steps should be run from an (elevated*) Windows PowerShell prompt. 
#
#  (*In a default installation of containers on Windows following the quick-start guidance at
#    https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start,
#    the docker.exe client must run elevated to be able to connect to the daemon).
#
# 1. Clone the sources from github.com:
#
#    >>   git clone https://github.com/docker/docker.git C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker
#    >>   Cloning into 'C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker'...
#    >>   remote: Counting objects: 186216, done.
#    >>   remote: Compressing objects: 100% (21/21), done.
#    >>   remote: Total 186216 (delta 5), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 186195
#    >>   Receiving objects: 100% (186216/186216), 104.32 MiB | 8.18 MiB/s, done.
#    >>   Resolving deltas: 100% (123139/123139), done.
#    >>   Checking connectivity... done.
#    >>   Checking out files: 100% (3912/3912), done.
#    >>   PS C:\>
#
#
# 2. Change directory to the cloned docker sources:
#
#    >>   cd C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker 
#
#
# 3. Build a docker image with the components required to build the docker binaries from source
#    by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows .          
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows -m 2GB .    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 4. Build the docker executable binaries by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   docker run --name binaries nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary
#    >>   docker run --name binaries -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 5. Copy the binaries out of the container, replacing HostPath with an appropriate destination 
#    folder on the host system where you want the binaries to be located.
#
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\docker.exe C:\HostPath\docker.exe
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\dockerd.exe C:\HostPath\dockerd.exe
#
#
# 6. (Optional) Remove the interim container holding the built executable binaries:
#
#    >>    docker rm binaries
#
#
# 7. (Optional) Remove the image used for the container in which the executable
#    binaries are build. Tip - it may be useful to keep this image around if you need to
#    build multiple times. Then you can take advantage of the builder cache to have an
#    image which has all the components required to build the binaries already installed.
#
#    >>    docker rmi nativebuildimage
#

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  The validation tests can either run in a container, or directly on the host. To run in a
#  container, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then run one of the
#  following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run --rm nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -DCO -PkgImports -GoFormat
#    >>   docker run --rm -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -DCO -PkgImports -GoFormat    (if using Hyper-V containers)

# To run the validation tests on the host, from the root of the repository, run the
# following from a Windows PowerShell prompt (elevation is not required): (Note Go
# must be installed to run these tests)
#
#    >>   hack\make.ps1 -DCO -PkgImports -GoFormat

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run unit tests, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then run one of
#  the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run --rm nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -TestUnit
#    >>   docker run --rm -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -TestUnit    (if using Hyper-V containers)


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run all tests and binary build, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then 
#  run one of the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -All
#    >>   docker run -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -All    (if using Hyper-V containers)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Important notes:
# ---------------
#
# Don't attempt to use a bind-mount to pass a local directory as the bundles target
# directory. It does not work (golang attempts for follow a mapped folder incorrectly). 
# Instead, use docker cp as per the example.
#
# go.zip is not removed from the image as it is used by the Windows CI servers
# to ensure the host and image are running consistent versions of go.
#
# Nanoserver support is a work in progress. Although the image will build if the 
# FROM statement is updated, it will not work when running autogen through hack\make.ps1. 
# It is suspected that the required GCC utilities (eg gcc, windres, windmc) silently
# quit due to the use of console hooks which are not available.
#
# The docker integration tests do not currently run in a container on Windows, predominantly
# due to Windows not supporting privileged mode, so anything using a volume would fail.
# They (along with the rest of the docker CI suite) can be run using 
# https://github.com/jhowardmsft/docker-w2wCIScripts/blob/master/runCI/Invoke-DockerCI.ps1.

# This file describes the standard way to build Docker in a container on Windows
# Server 2016 or Windows 10.
#
# Maintainer: @jhowardmsft
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Prerequisites:
# --------------
#
# 1. Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10 with all Windows updates applied. The major 
#    build number must be at least 14393. This can be confirmed, for example, by 
#    running the following from an elevated PowerShell prompt - this sample output 
#    is from a fully up to date machine as at mid-November 2016:
#
#    >> PS C:\> $(gin).WindowsBuildLabEx
#    >> 14393.447.amd64fre.rs1_release_inmarket.161102-0100
#
# 2. Git for Windows (or another git client) must be installed. https://git-scm.com/download/win.
#
# 3. The machine must be configured to run containers. For example, by following
#    the quick start guidance at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start or
#    https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/windows/windows-containers/Setup.md
#
# 4. If building in a Hyper-V VM: For Windows Server 2016 using Windows Server
#    containers as the default option, it is recommended you have at least 1GB 
#    of memory assigned; For Windows 10 where Hyper-V Containers are employed, you

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file describes the standard way to build Docker in a container on Windows
# Server 2016 or Windows 10.
#
# Maintainer: @jhowardmsft
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Prerequisites:
# --------------
#
# 1. Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10 with all Windows updates applied. The major 
#    build number must be at least 14393. This can be confirmed, for example, by 
#    running the following from an elevated PowerShell prompt - this sample output 
#    is from a fully up to date machine as at mid-November 2016:
#
#    >> PS C:\> $(gin).WindowsBuildLabEx
#    >> 14393.447.amd64fre.rs1_release_inmarket.161102-0100
#
# 2. Git for Windows (or another git client) must be installed. https://git-scm.com/download/win.
#
# 3. The machine must be configured to run containers. For example, by following
#    the quick start guidance at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start or
#    https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/windows/windows-containers/Setup.md
#
# 4. If building in a Hyper-V VM: For Windows Server 2016 using Windows Server
#    containers as the default option, it is recommended you have at least 1GB 
#    of memory assigned; For Windows 10 where Hyper-V Containers are employed, you
#    should have at least 4GB of memory assigned. Note also, to run Hyper-V 
#    containers in a VM, it is necessary to configure the VM for nested virtualization.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Usage:
# -----
#
#  The following steps should be run from an (elevated*) Windows PowerShell prompt. 
#
#  (*In a default installation of containers on Windows following the quick-start guidance at
#    https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start,
#    the docker.exe client must run elevated to be able to connect to the daemon).
#
# 1. Clone the sources from github.com:
#
#    >>   git clone https://github.com/docker/docker.git C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker
#    >>   Cloning into 'C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker'...
#    >>   remote: Counting objects: 186216, done.
#    >>   remote: Compressing objects: 100% (21/21), done.
#    >>   remote: Total 186216 (delta 5), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 186195
#    >>   Receiving objects: 100% (186216/186216), 104.32 MiB | 8.18 MiB/s, done.
#    >>   Resolving deltas: 100% (123139/123139), done.
#    >>   Checking connectivity... done.
#    >>   Checking out files: 100% (3912/3912), done.
#    >>   PS C:\>
#
#
# 2. Change directory to the cloned docker sources:
#
#    >>   cd C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker 
#
#
# 3. Build a docker image with the components required to build the docker binaries from source
#    by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows .          
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows -m 2GB .    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 4. Build the docker executable binaries by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   docker run --name binaries nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary
#    >>   docker run --name binaries -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 5. Copy the binaries out of the container, replacing HostPath with an appropriate destination 
#    folder on the host system where you want the binaries to be located.
#
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\docker.exe C:\HostPath\docker.exe
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\dockerd.exe C:\HostPath\dockerd.exe
#
#
# 6. (Optional) Remove the interim container holding the built executable binaries:
#
#    >>    docker rm binaries
#
#
# 7. (Optional) Remove the image used for the container in which the executable
#    binaries are build. Tip - it may be useful to keep this image around if you need to
#    build multiple times. Then you can take advantage of the builder cache to have an
#    image which has all the components required to build the binaries already installed.
#
#    >>    docker rmi nativebuildimage
#

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  The validation tests can either run in a container, or directly on the host. To run in a
#  container, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then run one of the
#  following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run --rm nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -DCO -PkgImports -GoFormat
#    >>   docker run --rm -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -DCO -PkgImports -GoFormat    (if using Hyper-V containers)

# To run the validation tests on the host, from the root of the repository, run the
# following from a Windows PowerShell prompt (elevation is not required): (Note Go
# must be installed to run these tests)
#
#    >>   hack\make.ps1 -DCO -PkgImports -GoFormat

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run unit tests, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then run one of
#  the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run --rm nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -TestUnit
#    >>   docker run --rm -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -TestUnit    (if using Hyper-V containers)


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run all tests and binary build, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then 
#  run one of the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -All
#    >>   docker run -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -All    (if using Hyper-V containers)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Important notes:
# ---------------
#
# Don't attempt to use a bind-mount to pass a local directory as the bundles target
# directory. It does not work (golang attempts for follow a mapped folder incorrectly). 
# Instead, use docker cp as per the example.
#
# go.zip is not removed from the image as it is used by the Windows CI servers
# to ensure the host and image are running consistent versions of go.
#
# Nanoserver support is a work in progress. Although the image will build if the 
# FROM statement is updated, it will not work when running autogen through hack\make.ps1. 
# It is suspected that the required GCC utilities (eg gcc, windres, windmc) silently
# quit due to the use of console hooks which are not available.
#
# The docker integration tests do not currently run in a container on Windows, predominantly
# due to Windows not supporting privileged mode, so anything using a volume would fail.
# They (along with the rest of the docker CI suite) can be run using 
# https://github.com/jhowardmsft/docker-w2wCIScripts/blob/master/runCI/Invoke-DockerCI.ps1.
