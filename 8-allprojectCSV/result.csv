# Server 2016
#
# Usage:
#
# # Assemble the full dev environment. This is slow the first time. Run this from
# # a directory containing the sources you are validating. For example from 
# # c:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker
#
# docker build -t docker -f Dockerfile.windows .
#
#
# # Build docker in a container. Run the following from a Windows cmd command prommpt,
# # replacing c:\built with the directory you want the binaries to be placed on the
# # host system.
#
# docker run --rm -v ""c:\built:c:\target"" docker sh -c 'cd /c/go/src/github.com/docker/docker; hack/make.sh binary; ec=$?; if [ $ec -eq 0 ]; then robocopy /c/go/src/github.com/docker/docker/bundles/$(cat VERSION)/binary /c/target/binary; fi; exit $ec'
#
# Important notes:
# ---------------
#
# Multiple commands in a single powershell RUN command are deliberately not done. This is
# because PS doesn't have a concept quite like set -e in bash. It would be possible to use 
# try-catch script blocks, but that would make this file unreadable. The problem is that
# if there are two commands eg ""RUN powershell -command fail; succeed"", as far as docker
# would be concerned, the return code from the overall RUN is succeed. This doesn't apply to
# RUN which uses cmd as the command interpreter such as ""RUN fail; succeed"".
#
# 'sleep 5' is a deliberate workaround for a current problem on containers in Windows 
# Server 2016. It ensures that the network is up and available for when the command is
# network related. This bug is being tracked internally at Microsoft and exists in TP4.
# Generally sleep 1 or 2 is probably enough, but making it 5 to make the build file
# as bullet proof as possible. This isn't a big deal as this only runs the first time.
#

#
# 'Start-Sleep' is a deliberate workaround for a current problem on containers in Windows 
# Server 2016. It ensures that the network is up and available for when the command is
# network related. This bug is being tracked internally at Microsoft and exists in TP4.
# Generally sleep 1 or 2 is probably enough, but making it 5 to make the build file
# as bullet proof as possible. This isn't a big deal as this only runs the first time.

#
# Maintainer: @jhowardmsft
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Prerequisites:
# --------------
#
# 1. Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 with all Windows updates applied. Pre-release
#    versions of Windows are not supported (eg Windows Server 2016 TP5). The build
#    number must be at least 14393. This can be confirmed, for example, by running
#    the following from an elevated PowerShell prompt - this sample output is from a 
#    fully up to date machine as at late October 2016:
#
#    >> PS C:\> $(gin).WindowsBuildLabEx
#    >> 14393.321.amd64fre.rs1_release_inmarket.161004-2338
#
# 2. Git for Windows (or another git client) must be installed. https://git-scm.com/download/win.
#
# 3. The machine must be configured to run containers. For example, by following
#    the quick start guidance at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start or
#    https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/windows/windows-containers/Setup.md


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Usage:
# -----
#
#  The following steps should be run from an (elevated*) Windows PowerShell prompt. 
#
#  (*In a default installation of containers on Windows following the quick-start guidance at
#    https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start,
#    the docker.exe client must run elevated to be able to connect to the daemon).
#
# 1. Clone the sources from github.com:
#
#    >>   git clone https://github.com/docker/docker.git c:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker

#    >>   Checking out files: 100% (3912/3912), done.
#    >>   PS C:\>
#
#
# 2. Change directory to the cloned docker sources:
#
#    >>   cd c:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker 
#
#
# 3. Build a docker image with the components required to build the docker binaries from source:
#
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows .
#
#
# 4. Build the docker executable binaries in a container:
#
#    >>   docker run --name binaries nativebuildimage sh -c 'cd /c/go/src/github.com/docker/docker; hack/make.sh binary'
#
#
# 5. Copy the binaries out of the above container, replacing HostPath with an appropriate destination 
#    folder on the host system where you want the binaries to be located.
#
#    >>   $v=$(Get-Content "".\VERSION"" -raw).ToString().Replace(""`n"","""").Trim()
#    >>   docker cp binaries:c:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\$v\binary-client\docker-$v.exe c:\HostPath\docker.exe
#    >>   docker cp binaries:c:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\$v\binary-daemon\dockerd.exe c:\HostPath\dockerd.exe
#    >>   docker cp binaries:c:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\$v\binary-daemon\docker-proxy-$v.exe c:\HostPath\docker-proxy.exe
#
#
# 6. (Optional) Remove the interim container holding the built executable binaries:
#
#    >>    docker rm binaries
#
#
# 7. (Optional) Remove the image used for the container in which the executable
#    binaries are build. Tip - it may be useful to keep this image around if you need to
#    build multiple times. Then you can take advantage of the builder cache to have an
#    image which has all the components required to build the binaries already installed.

# Important notes:
# ---------------
#
# The posix utilities from git aren't usable interactively as at October 2016. This
# is because they require a console window which isn't present in a container in Windows.
# See the example at the top of this file. Do NOT use -it in that docker run. It will not work.
#
# Don't attempt to use a volume for passing the source through to the container. The posix utilities will
# balk at reparse points. 
#
# The downloaded files are not cleared from the image. go.zip is used by the Windows
# CI servers to ensure the host and image are running consistent versions of go.
#
# The GIT installer isn't very good at unattended install. We use techniques described
# at the links below to force it to set the path and other options accordingly.

# As of October 2016, this does not work on Windows 10 client, just Windows Server 2016,
# and only with the default isolation mode (process). It does not work with isolation mode

# Prerequisites:
# --------------
#
# 1. Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10 with all Windows updates applied. The major 
#    build number must be at least 14393. This can be confirmed, for example, by 
#    running the following from an elevated PowerShell prompt - this sample output 
#    is from a fully up to date machine as at mid-November 2016:
#
#    >> PS C:\> $(gin).WindowsBuildLabEx
#    >> 14393.447.amd64fre.rs1_release_inmarket.161102-0100
#
# 2. Git for Windows (or another git client) must be installed. https://git-scm.com/download/win.
#
# 3. The machine must be configured to run containers. For example, by following
#    the quick start guidance at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start or
#    https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/windows/windows-containers/Setup.md
#
# 4. If building in a Hyper-V VM: For Windows Server 2016 using Windows Server
#    containers as the default option, it is recommended you have at least 1GB 
#    of memory assigned; For Windows 10 where Hyper-V Containers are employed, you
#    should have at least 4GB of memory assigned. Note also, to run Hyper-V 
#    containers in a VM, it is necessary to configure the VM for nested virtualization.

# This file describes the standard way to build Docker in a container on Windows
# Server 2016 or Windows 10.
#
# Maintainer: @jhowardmsft
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Prerequisites:
# --------------
#
# 1. Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10 with all Windows updates applied. The major 
#    build number must be at least 14393. This can be confirmed, for example, by 
#    running the following from an elevated PowerShell prompt - this sample output 
#    is from a fully up to date machine as at mid-November 2016:
#
#    >> PS C:\> $(gin).WindowsBuildLabEx
#    >> 14393.447.amd64fre.rs1_release_inmarket.161102-0100
#
# 2. Git for Windows (or another git client) must be installed. https://git-scm.com/download/win.
#
# 3. The machine must be configured to run containers. For example, by following
#    the quick start guidance at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start or
#    https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/windows/windows-containers/Setup.md
#
# 4. If building in a Hyper-V VM: For Windows Server 2016 using Windows Server
#    containers as the default option, it is recommended you have at least 1GB 
#    of memory assigned; For Windows 10 where Hyper-V Containers are employed, you
#    should have at least 4GB of memory assigned. Note also, to run Hyper-V 
#    containers in a VM, it is necessary to configure the VM for nested virtualization.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Usage:
# -----
#
#  The following steps should be run from an (elevated*) Windows PowerShell prompt. 
#
#  (*In a default installation of containers on Windows following the quick-start guidance at
#    https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start,
#    the docker.exe client must run elevated to be able to connect to the daemon).
#
# 1. Clone the sources from github.com:
#
#    >>   git clone https://github.com/docker/docker.git C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker
#    >>   Cloning into 'C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker'...
#    >>   remote: Counting objects: 186216, done.
#    >>   remote: Compressing objects: 100% (21/21), done.
#    >>   remote: Total 186216 (delta 5), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 186195
#    >>   Receiving objects: 100% (186216/186216), 104.32 MiB | 8.18 MiB/s, done.
#    >>   Resolving deltas: 100% (123139/123139), done.
#    >>   Checking connectivity... done.
#    >>   Checking out files: 100% (3912/3912), done.
#    >>   PS C:\>
#
#
# 2. Change directory to the cloned docker sources:
#
#    >>   cd C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker 
#
#
# 3. Build a docker image with the components required to build the docker binaries from source
#    by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows .          
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows -m 2GB .    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 4. Build the docker executable binaries by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   $DOCKER_GITCOMMIT=(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
#    >>   docker run --name binaries -e DOCKER_GITCOMMIT=$DOCKER_GITCOMMIT nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary
#    >>   docker run --name binaries -e DOCKER_GITCOMMIT=$DOCKER_GITCOMMIT -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 5. Copy the binaries out of the container, replacing HostPath with an appropriate destination 
#    folder on the host system where you want the binaries to be located.
#
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\docker.exe C:\HostPath\docker.exe
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\dockerd.exe C:\HostPath\dockerd.exe
#
#
# 6. (Optional) Remove the interim container holding the built executable binaries:
#
#    >>    docker rm binaries
#
#
# 7. (Optional) Remove the image used for the container in which the executable
#    binaries are build. Tip - it may be useful to keep this image around if you need to
#    build multiple times. Then you can take advantage of the builder cache to have an
#    image which has all the components required to build the binaries already installed.
#
#    >>    docker rmi nativebuildimage
#

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  The validation tests can only run directly on the host. This is because they calculate
#  information from the git repo, but the .git directory is not passed into the image as
#  it is excluded via .dockerignore. Run the following from a Windows PowerShell prompt
#  (elevation is not required): (Note Go must be installed to run these tests)
#
#    >>   hack\make.ps1 -DCO -PkgImports -GoFormat


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run unit tests, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then run one of
#  the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run --rm nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -TestUnit
#    >>   docker run --rm -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -TestUnit    (if using Hyper-V containers)


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run unit tests and binary build, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then 
#  run one of the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -All
#    >>   docker run -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -All    (if using Hyper-V containers)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Important notes:
# ---------------
#
# Don't attempt to use a bind mount to pass a local directory as the bundles target
# directory. It does not work (golang attempts for follow a mapped folder incorrectly).
# Instead, use docker cp as per the example.
#
# go.zip is not removed from the image as it is used by the Windows CI servers

# 2. Git for Windows (or another git client) must be installed. https://git-scm.com/download/win.
#
# 3. The machine must be configured to run containers. For example, by following
#    the quick start guidance at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start or
#    https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/windows/windows-containers/Setup.md
#
# 4. If building in a Hyper-V VM: For Windows Server 2016 using Windows Server
#    containers as the default option, it is recommended you have at least 1GB 
#    of memory assigned; For Windows 10 where Hyper-V Containers are employed, you
#    should have at least 4GB of memory assigned. Note also, to run Hyper-V 
#    containers in a VM, it is necessary to configure the VM for nested virtualization.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Usage:
# -----
#
#  The following steps should be run from an (elevated*) Windows PowerShell prompt. 
#
#  (*In a default installation of containers on Windows following the quick-start guidance at
#    https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start,
#    the docker.exe client must run elevated to be able to connect to the daemon).
#
# 1. Clone the sources from github.com:
#
#    >>   git clone https://github.com/docker/docker.git C:\gopath\src\github.com\docker\docker
#    >>   Cloning into 'C:\gopath\src\github.com\docker\docker'...
#    >>   remote: Counting objects: 186216, done.
#    >>   remote: Compressing objects: 100% (21/21), done.
#    >>   remote: Total 186216 (delta 5), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 186195
#    >>   Receiving objects: 100% (186216/186216), 104.32 MiB | 8.18 MiB/s, done.
#    >>   Resolving deltas: 100% (123139/123139), done.
#    >>   Checking connectivity... done.
#    >>   Checking out files: 100% (3912/3912), done.
#    >>   PS C:\>
#
#
# 2. Change directory to the cloned docker sources:
#
#    >>   cd C:\gopath\src\github.com\docker\docker 
#
#
# 3. Build a docker image with the components required to build the docker binaries from source
#    by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows .          
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows -m 2GB .    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 4. Build the docker executable binaries by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   $DOCKER_GITCOMMIT=(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
#    >>   docker run --name binaries -e DOCKER_GITCOMMIT=$DOCKER_GITCOMMIT nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary
#    >>   docker run --name binaries -e DOCKER_GITCOMMIT=$DOCKER_GITCOMMIT -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 5. Copy the binaries out of the container, replacing HostPath with an appropriate destination 
#    folder on the host system where you want the binaries to be located.
#
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\gopath\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\docker.exe C:\HostPath\docker.exe
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\gopath\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\dockerd.exe C:\HostPath\dockerd.exe
#
#
# 6. (Optional) Remove the interim container holding the built executable binaries:
#
#    >>    docker rm binaries
#
#
# 7. (Optional) Remove the image used for the container in which the executable
#    binaries are build. Tip - it may be useful to keep this image around if you need to
#    build multiple times. Then you can take advantage of the builder cache to have an
#    image which has all the components required to build the binaries already installed.
#
#    >>    docker rmi nativebuildimage
#

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  The validation tests can only run directly on the host. This is because they calculate
#  information from the git repo, but the .git directory is not passed into the image as
#  it is excluded via .dockerignore. Run the following from a Windows PowerShell prompt
#  (elevation is not required): (Note Go must be installed to run these tests)
#
#    >>   hack\make.ps1 -DCO -PkgImports -GoFormat


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run unit tests, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then run one of
#  the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run --rm nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -TestUnit
#    >>   docker run --rm -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -TestUnit    (if using Hyper-V containers)


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run unit tests and binary build, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then 
#  run one of the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -All
#    >>   docker run -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -All    (if using Hyper-V containers)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Important notes:
# ---------------
#
# Don't attempt to use a bind mount to pass a local directory as the bundles target
# directory. It does not work (golang attempts for follow a mapped folder incorrectly).
# Instead, use docker cp as per the example.
#
# go.zip is not removed from the image as it is used by the Windows CI servers
# to ensure the host and image are running consistent versions of go.
#
# Nanoserver support is a work in progress. Although the image will build if the 
# FROM statement is updated, it will not work when running autogen through hack\make.ps1. 
# It is suspected that the required GCC utilities (eg gcc, windres, windmc) silently
# quit due to the use of console hooks which are not available.
#
# The docker integration tests do not currently run in a container on Windows, predominantly
# due to Windows not supporting privileged mode, so anything using a volume would fail.
# They (along with the rest of the docker CI suite) can be run using 
# https://github.com/kevpar/docker-w2wCIScripts/blob/master/runCI/Invoke-DockerCI.ps1.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# The number of build steps below are explicitly minimised to improve performance.

# Extremely important - do not change the following line to reference a ""specific"" image, 
# such as `mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019`. If using this Dockerfile in process
# isolated containers, the kernel of the host must match the container image, and hence
# would fail between Windows Server 2016 (aka RS1) and Windows Server 2019 (aka RS5).
# It is expected that the image `microsoft/windowsservercore:latest` is present, and matches
# the hosts kernel version before doing a build.

# Important notes:
# ---------------
#
# Multiple commands in a single powershell RUN command are deliberately not done. This is
# because PS doesn't have a concept quite like set -e in bash. It would be possible to use 
# try-catch script blocks, but that would make this file unreadable. The problem is that
# if there are two commands eg ""RUN powershell -command fail; succeed"", as far as docker
# would be concerned, the return code from the overall RUN is succeed. This doesn't apply to
# RUN which uses cmd as the command interpreter such as ""RUN fail; succeed"".
#
# 'sleep 5' is a deliberate workaround for a current problem on containers in Windows 
# Server 2016. It ensures that the network is up and available for when the command is
# network related. This bug is being tracked internally at Microsoft and exists in TP4.
# Generally sleep 1 or 2 is probably enough, but making it 5 to make the build file
# as bullet proof as possible. This isn't a big deal as this only runs the first time.
#
# The cygwin posix utilities from GIT aren't usable interactively as at January 2016. This
# is because they require a console window which isn't present in a container in Windows.
# See the example at the top of this file. Do NOT use -it in that docker run!!! 
#

# Prerequisites:
# --------------
#
# 1. Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 with all Windows updates applied. Pre-release
#    versions of Windows are not supported (eg Windows Server 2016 TP5). The build
#    number must be at least 14393. This can be confirmed, for example, by running
#    the following from an elevated PowerShell prompt - this sample output is from a 
#    fully up to date machine as at late October 2016:
#
#    >> PS C:\> $(gin).WindowsBuildLabEx
#    >> 14393.321.amd64fre.rs1_release_inmarket.161004-2338
#
# 2. Git for Windows (or another git client) must be installed. https://git-scm.com/download/win.
#
# 3. The machine must be configured to run containers. For example, by following
#    the quick start guidance at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start or
#    https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/windows/windows-containers/Setup.md


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Usage:
# -----
#
#  The following steps should be run from an (elevated*) Windows PowerShell prompt. 
#
#  (*In a default installation of containers on Windows following the quick-start guidance at
#    https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start,
#    the docker.exe client must run elevated to be able to connect to the daemon).

#
#
# 2. Change directory to the cloned docker sources:
#
#    >>   cd c:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker 
#
#
# 3. Build a docker image with the components required to build the docker binaries from source:
#
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows .
#
#
# 4. Build the docker executable binaries in a container:
#
#    >>   docker run --name binaries nativebuildimage sh -c 'cd /c/go/src/github.com/docker/docker; hack/make.sh binary'
#
#
# 5. Copy the binaries out of the above container, replacing HostPath with an appropriate destination 
#    folder on the host system where you want the binaries to be located.
#
#    >>   $v=$(Get-Content "".\VERSION"" -raw).ToString().Replace(""`n"","""").Trim()
#    >>   docker cp binaries:c:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\$v\binary-client\docker-$v.exe c:\HostPath\docker.exe

#    >>   docker cp binaries:c:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\$v\binary-daemon\docker-proxy-$v.exe c:\HostPath\docker-proxy.exe
#
#
# 6. (Optional) Remove the interim container holding the built executable binaries:
#
#    >>    docker rm binaries
#
#
# 7. (Optional) Remove the image used for the container in which the executable
#    binaries are build. Tip - it may be useful to keep this image around if you need to
#    build multiple times. Then you can take advantage of the builder cache to have an
#    image which has all the components required to build the binaries already installed.

# Prerequisites:
# --------------
#
# 1. Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 with all Windows updates applied. Pre-release
#    versions of Windows are not supported (eg Windows Server 2016 TP5). The build
#    number must be at least 14393. This can be confirmed, for example, by running

#    fully up to date machine as at late October 2016:
#
#    >> PS C:\> $(gin).WindowsBuildLabEx
#    >> 14393.321.amd64fre.rs1_release_inmarket.161004-2338
#
# 2. Git for Windows (or another git client) must be installed. https://git-scm.com/download/win.
#
# 3. The machine must be configured to run containers. For example, by following
#    the quick start guidance at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start or
#    https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/windows/windows-containers/Setup.md

#
#
# 5. Copy the binaries out of the above container, replacing HostPath with an appropriate destination

#
# Don't attempt to use a bind-mount to pass a local directory as the bundles target
# directory. It does not work (golang attempts for follow a mapped folder incorrectly). 
# Instead, use docker cp as per the example.
#
# go.zip is not removed from the image as it is used by the Windows CI servers
# to ensure the host and image are running consistent versions of go.
#
# Nanoserver support is a work in progress. Although the image will build if the 
# FROM statement is updated, it will not work when running autogen through hack\make.ps1. 
# It is suspected that the required GCC utilities (eg gcc, windres, windmc) silently
# quit due to the use of console hooks which are not available.
#
# The docker integration tests do not currently run in a container on Windows, predominantly
# due to Windows not supporting privileged mode, so anything using a volume would fail.
# They (along with the rest of the docker CI suite) can be run using

# This file describes the standard way to build Docker in a container on Windows
# Server 2016 or Windows 10.
#
# Maintainer: @jhowardmsft
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Prerequisites:
# --------------
#
# 1. Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10 with all Windows updates applied. The major 
#    build number must be at least 14393. This can be confirmed, for example, by 
#    running the following from an elevated PowerShell prompt - this sample output 
#    is from a fully up to date machine as at mid-November 2016:
#
#    >> PS C:\> $(gin).WindowsBuildLabEx
#    >> 14393.447.amd64fre.rs1_release_inmarket.161102-0100
#
# 2. Git for Windows (or another git client) must be installed. https://git-scm.com/download/win.
#
# 3. The machine must be configured to run containers. For example, by following
#    the quick start guidance at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start or
#    https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/windows/windows-containers/Setup.md
#
# 4. If building in a Hyper-V VM: For Windows Server 2016 using Windows Server
#    containers as the default option, it is recommended you have at least 1GB 
#    of memory assigned; For Windows 10 where Hyper-V Containers are employed, you
#    should have at least 4GB of memory assigned. Note also, to run Hyper-V 
#    containers in a VM, it is necessary to configure the VM for nested virtualization.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Usage:
# -----
#
#  The following steps should be run from an (elevated*) Windows PowerShell prompt. 
#
#  (*In a default installation of containers on Windows following the quick-start guidance at
#    https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start,
#    the docker.exe client must run elevated to be able to connect to the daemon).
#
# 1. Clone the sources from github.com:
#
#    >>   git clone https://github.com/docker/docker.git C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker
#    >>   Cloning into 'C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker'...
#    >>   remote: Counting objects: 186216, done.
#    >>   remote: Compressing objects: 100% (21/21), done.
#    >>   remote: Total 186216 (delta 5), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 186195
#    >>   Receiving objects: 100% (186216/186216), 104.32 MiB | 8.18 MiB/s, done.
#    >>   Resolving deltas: 100% (123139/123139), done.
#    >>   Checking connectivity... done.
#    >>   Checking out files: 100% (3912/3912), done.
#    >>   PS C:\>
#
#
# 2. Change directory to the cloned docker sources:
#
#    >>   cd C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker 
#
#
# 3. Build a docker image with the components required to build the docker binaries from source
#    by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows .          
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows -m 2GB .    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 4. Build the docker executable binaries by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   docker run --name binaries nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary
#    >>   docker run --name binaries -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 5. Copy the binaries out of the container, replacing HostPath with an appropriate destination 
#    folder on the host system where you want the binaries to be located.
#
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\docker.exe C:\HostPath\docker.exe
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\dockerd.exe C:\HostPath\dockerd.exe
#
#
# 6. (Optional) Remove the interim container holding the built executable binaries:
#
#    >>    docker rm binaries
#
#
# 7. (Optional) Remove the image used for the container in which the executable
#    binaries are build. Tip - it may be useful to keep this image around if you need to
#    build multiple times. Then you can take advantage of the builder cache to have an
#    image which has all the components required to build the binaries already installed.
#
#    >>    docker rmi nativebuildimage
#

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  The validation tests can either run in a container, or directly on the host. To run in a
#  container, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then run one of the
#  following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run --rm nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -DCO -PkgImports -GoFormat
#    >>   docker run --rm -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -DCO -PkgImports -GoFormat    (if using Hyper-V containers)

# To run the validation tests on the host, from the root of the repository, run the
# following from a Windows PowerShell prompt (elevation is not required): (Note Go
# must be installed to run these tests)
#
#    >>   hack\make.ps1 -DCO -PkgImports -GoFormat

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run unit tests, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then run one of
#  the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run --rm nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -TestUnit
#    >>   docker run --rm -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -TestUnit    (if using Hyper-V containers)


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run all tests and binary build, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then 
#  run one of the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -All
#    >>   docker run -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -All    (if using Hyper-V containers)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file describes the standard way to build Docker in a container on Windows
# Server 2016 or Windows 10.
#
# Maintainer: @jhowardmsft
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Prerequisites:
# --------------
#
# 1. Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10 with all Windows updates applied. The major 
#    build number must be at least 14393. This can be confirmed, for example, by 
#    running the following from an elevated PowerShell prompt - this sample output 
#    is from a fully up to date machine as at mid-November 2016:
#
#    >> PS C:\> $(gin).WindowsBuildLabEx
#    >> 14393.447.amd64fre.rs1_release_inmarket.161102-0100
#
# 2. Git for Windows (or another git client) must be installed. https://git-scm.com/download/win.
#
# 3. The machine must be configured to run containers. For example, by following
#    the quick start guidance at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start or
#    https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/windows/windows-containers/Setup.md
#
# 4. If building in a Hyper-V VM: For Windows Server 2016 using Windows Server
#    containers as the default option, it is recommended you have at least 1GB 
#    of memory assigned; For Windows 10 where Hyper-V Containers are employed, you
#    should have at least 4GB of memory assigned. Note also, to run Hyper-V 
#    containers in a VM, it is necessary to configure the VM for nested virtualization.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Usage:
# -----
#
#  The following steps should be run from an (elevated*) Windows PowerShell prompt. 
#
#  (*In a default installation of containers on Windows following the quick-start guidance at
#    https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start,
#    the docker.exe client must run elevated to be able to connect to the daemon).
#
# 1. Clone the sources from github.com:
#
#    >>   git clone https://github.com/docker/docker.git C:\gopath\src\github.com\docker\docker
#    >>   Cloning into 'C:\gopath\src\github.com\docker\docker'...
#    >>   remote: Counting objects: 186216, done.
#    >>   remote: Compressing objects: 100% (21/21), done.
#    >>   remote: Total 186216 (delta 5), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 186195
#    >>   Receiving objects: 100% (186216/186216), 104.32 MiB | 8.18 MiB/s, done.
#    >>   Resolving deltas: 100% (123139/123139), done.
#    >>   Checking connectivity... done.
#    >>   Checking out files: 100% (3912/3912), done.
#    >>   PS C:\>
#
#
# 2. Change directory to the cloned docker sources:
#
#    >>   cd C:\gopath\src\github.com\docker\docker 
#
#
# 3. Build a docker image with the components required to build the docker binaries from source
#    by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows .          
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows -m 2GB .    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 4. Build the docker executable binaries by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   $DOCKER_GITCOMMIT=(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
#    >>   docker run --name binaries -e DOCKER_GITCOMMIT=$DOCKER_GITCOMMIT nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary
#    >>   docker run --name binaries -e DOCKER_GITCOMMIT=$DOCKER_GITCOMMIT -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 5. Copy the binaries out of the container, replacing HostPath with an appropriate destination 
#    folder on the host system where you want the binaries to be located.
#
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\gopath\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\docker.exe C:\HostPath\docker.exe
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\gopath\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\dockerd.exe C:\HostPath\dockerd.exe
#
#
# 6. (Optional) Remove the interim container holding the built executable binaries:
#
#    >>    docker rm binaries
#
#
# 7. (Optional) Remove the image used for the container in which the executable
#    binaries are build. Tip - it may be useful to keep this image around if you need to
#    build multiple times. Then you can take advantage of the builder cache to have an
#    image which has all the components required to build the binaries already installed.
#
#    >>    docker rmi nativebuildimage
#

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  The validation tests can only run directly on the host. This is because they calculate
#  information from the git repo, but the .git directory is not passed into the image as
#  it is excluded via .dockerignore. Run the following from a Windows PowerShell prompt
#  (elevation is not required): (Note Go must be installed to run these tests)
#
#    >>   hack\make.ps1 -DCO -PkgImports -GoFormat


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run unit tests, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then run one of
#  the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run --rm nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -TestUnit
#    >>   docker run --rm -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -TestUnit    (if using Hyper-V containers)


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run unit tests and binary build, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then 
#  run one of the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -All
#    >>   docker run -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -All    (if using Hyper-V containers)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Important notes:
# ---------------
#
# Don't attempt to use a bind mount to pass a local directory as the bundles target
# directory. It does not work (golang attempts for follow a mapped folder incorrectly).
# Instead, use docker cp as per the example.
#
# go.zip is not removed from the image as it is used by the Windows CI servers
# to ensure the host and image are running consistent versions of go.
#
# Nanoserver support is a work in progress. Although the image will build if the 
# FROM statement is updated, it will not work when running autogen through hack\make.ps1. 
# It is suspected that the required GCC utilities (eg gcc, windres, windmc) silently
# quit due to the use of console hooks which are not available.
#
# The docker integration tests do not currently run in a container on Windows, predominantly
# due to Windows not supporting privileged mode, so anything using a volume would fail.
# They (along with the rest of the docker CI suite) can be run using 
# https://github.com/jhowardmsft/docker-w2wCIScripts/blob/master/runCI/Invoke-DockerCI.ps1.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# The number of build steps below are explicitly minimised to improve performance.

# Extremely important - do not change the following line to reference a ""specific"" image, 
# such as `mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019`. If using this Dockerfile in process
# isolated containers, the kernel of the host must match the container image, and hence
# would fail between Windows Server 2016 (aka RS1) and Windows Server 2019 (aka RS5).
# It is expected that the image `microsoft/windowsservercore:latest` is present, and matches
# the hosts kernel version before doing a build.

#
# Maintainer: @jhowardmsft
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Prerequisites:
# --------------
#
# 1. Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 with all Windows updates applied. Pre-release
#    versions of Windows are not supported (eg Windows Server 2016 TP5). The build
#    number must be at least 14393. This can be confirmed, for example, by running
#    the following from an elevated PowerShell prompt - this sample output is from a 
#    fully up to date machine as at late October 2016:
#
#    >> PS C:\> $(gin).WindowsBuildLabEx
#    >> 14393.321.amd64fre.rs1_release_inmarket.161004-2338
#
# 2. Git for Windows (or another git client) must be installed. https://git-scm.com/download/win.
#
# 3. The machine must be configured to run containers. For example, by following
#    the quick start guidance at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start or
#    https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/windows/windows-containers/Setup.md


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Usage:
# -----
#
#  The following steps should be run from an (elevated*) Windows PowerShell prompt. 
#
#  (*In a default installation of containers on Windows following the quick-start guidance at
#    https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start,
#    the docker.exe client must run elevated to be able to connect to the daemon).
#
# 1. Clone the sources from github.com:
#
#    >>   git clone https://github.com/docker/docker.git c:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker
#    >>   Cloning into 'c:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker'...
#    >>   remote: Counting objects: 186216, done.
#    >>   remote: Compressing objects: 100% (21/21), done.
#    >>   remote: Total 186216 (delta 5), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 186195
#    >>   Receiving objects: 100% (186216/186216), 104.32 MiB | 8.18 MiB/s, done.
#    >>   Resolving deltas: 100% (123139/123139), done.
#    >>   Checking connectivity... done.
#    >>   Checking out files: 100% (3912/3912), done.
#    >>   PS C:\>
#
#
# 2. Change directory to the cloned docker sources:
#
#    >>   cd c:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker 
#
#
# 3. Build a docker image with the components required to build the docker binaries from source:
#
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows .
#
#
# 4. Build the docker executable binaries in a container:
#
#    >>   docker run --name binaries nativebuildimage sh -c 'cd /c/go/src/github.com/docker/docker; hack/make.sh binary'
#
#
# 5. Copy the binaries out of the above container, replacing HostPath with an appropriate destination 
#    folder on the host system where you want the binaries to be located.
#
#    >>   $v=$(Get-Content "".\VERSION"" -raw).ToString().Replace(""`n"","""").Trim()
#    >>   docker cp binaries:c:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\$v\binary-client\docker-$v.exe c:\HostPath\docker.exe
#    >>   docker cp binaries:c:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\$v\binary-daemon\dockerd.exe c:\HostPath\dockerd.exe
#    >>   docker cp binaries:c:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\$v\binary-daemon\docker-proxy-$v.exe c:\HostPath\docker-proxy.exe
#
#
# 6. (Optional) Remove the interim container holding the built executable binaries:
#
#    >>    docker rm binaries
#
#
# 7. (Optional) Remove the image used for the container in which the executable
#    binaries are build. Tip - it may be useful to keep this image around if you need to
#    build multiple times. Then you can take advantage of the builder cache to have an
#    image which has all the components required to build the binaries already installed.
#
#    >>    docker rmi nativebuildimage

# ---------------
#
# Don't attempt to use a bind-mount to pass a local directory as the bundles target
# directory. It does not work (golang attempts for follow a mapped folder incorrectly). 
# Instead, use docker cp as per the example.
#
# go.zip is not removed from the image as it is used by the Windows CI servers
# to ensure the host and image are running consistent versions of go.
#
# Nanoserver support is a work in progress. Although the image will build if the 
# FROM statement is updated, it will not work when running autogen through hack\make.ps1. 
# It is suspected that the required GCC utilities (eg gcc, windres, windmc) silently
# quit due to the use of console hooks which are not available.
#
# The docker integration tests do not currently run in a container on Windows, predominantly
# due to Windows not supporting privileged mode, so anything using a volume would fail.
# They (along with the rest of the docker CI suite) can be run using

#
# 2. Change directory to the cloned docker sources:
#
#    >>   cd C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker 
#
#
# 3. Build a docker image with the components required to build the docker binaries from source
#    by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows .          
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows -m 2GB .    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 4. Build the docker executable binaries by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   $DOCKER_GITCOMMIT=(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
#    >>   docker run --name binaries -e DOCKER_GITCOMMIT=$DOCKER_GITCOMMIT nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary
#    >>   docker run --name binaries -e DOCKER_GITCOMMIT=$DOCKER_GITCOMMIT -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 5. Copy the binaries out of the container, replacing HostPath with an appropriate destination 
#    folder on the host system where you want the binaries to be located.
#
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\docker.exe C:\HostPath\docker.exe
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\dockerd.exe C:\HostPath\dockerd.exe
#
#
# 6. (Optional) Remove the interim container holding the built executable binaries:
#
#    >>    docker rm binaries
#
#
# 7. (Optional) Remove the image used for the container in which the executable
#    binaries are build. Tip - it may be useful to keep this image around if you need to
#    build multiple times. Then you can take advantage of the builder cache to have an
#    image which has all the components required to build the binaries already installed.
#
#    >>    docker rmi nativebuildimage
#

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  The validation tests can only run directly on the host. This is because they calculate
#  information from the git repo, but the .git directory is not passed into the image as
#  it is excluded via .dockerignore. Run the following from a Windows PowerShell prompt
#  (elevation is not required): (Note Go must be installed to run these tests)
#
#    >>   hack\make.ps1 -DCO -PkgImports -GoFormat


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run unit tests, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then run one of
#  the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run --rm nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -TestUnit
#    >>   docker run --rm -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -TestUnit    (if using Hyper-V containers)


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run unit tests and binary build, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then 
#  run one of the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -All
#    >>   docker run -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -All    (if using Hyper-V containers)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Important notes:
# ---------------
#
# Don't attempt to use a bind-mount to pass a local directory as the bundles target
# directory. It does not work (golang attempts for follow a mapped folder incorrectly). 
# Instead, use docker cp as per the example.
#
# go.zip is not removed from the image as it is used by the Windows CI servers
# to ensure the host and image are running consistent versions of go.
#
# Nanoserver support is a work in progress. Although the image will build if the 
# FROM statement is updated, it will not work when running autogen through hack\make.ps1. 
# It is suspected that the required GCC utilities (eg gcc, windres, windmc) silently
# quit due to the use of console hooks which are not available.
#
# The docker integration tests do not currently run in a container on Windows, predominantly
# due to Windows not supporting privileged mode, so anything using a volume would fail.
# They (along with the rest of the docker CI suite) can be run using

#
# Maintainer: @jhowardmsft
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Prerequisites:
# --------------
#
# 1. Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10 with all Windows updates applied. The major 
#    build number must be at least 14393. This can be confirmed, for example, by 
#    running the following from an elevated PowerShell prompt - this sample output 
#    is from a fully up to date machine as at mid-November 2016:
#
#    >> PS C:\> $(gin).WindowsBuildLabEx
#    >> 14393.447.amd64fre.rs1_release_inmarket.161102-0100
#
# 2. Git for Windows (or another git client) must be installed. https://git-scm.com/download/win.
#
# 3. The machine must be configured to run containers. For example, by following
#    the quick start guidance at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start or
#    https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/windows/windows-containers/Setup.md
#
# 4. If building in a Hyper-V VM: For Windows Server 2016 using Windows Server
#    containers as the default option, it is recommended you have at least 1GB 
#    of memory assigned; For Windows 10 where Hyper-V Containers are employed, you
#    should have at least 4GB of memory assigned. Note also, to run Hyper-V 
#    containers in a VM, it is necessary to configure the VM for nested virtualization.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Usage:
# -----
#
#  The following steps should be run from an (elevated*) Windows PowerShell prompt. 
#
#  (*In a default installation of containers on Windows following the quick-start guidance at
#    https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start,
#    the docker.exe client must run elevated to be able to connect to the daemon).
#
# 1. Clone the sources from github.com:
#
#    >>   git clone https://github.com/docker/docker.git C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker
#    >>   Cloning into 'C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker'...

#
#
# 4. Build the docker executable binaries by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   docker run --name binaries nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary
#    >>   docker run --name binaries -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 5. Copy the binaries out of the container, replacing HostPath with an appropriate destination 
#    folder on the host system where you want the binaries to be located.
#
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\docker.exe C:\HostPath\docker.exe
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\dockerd.exe C:\HostPath\dockerd.exe
#
#
# 6. (Optional) Remove the interim container holding the built executable binaries:

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run all tests and binary build, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then 
#  run one of the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:

#
# Nanoserver support is a work in progress. Although the image will build if the

#
# The docker integration tests do not currently run in a container on Windows, predominantly
# due to Windows not supporting privileged mode, so anything using a volume would fail.

# This file describes the standard way to build Docker in a container on Windows
# Server 2016 or Windows 10.
#
# Maintainer: @jhowardmsft
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Prerequisites:
# --------------
#
# 1. Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10 with all Windows updates applied. The major 
#    build number must be at least 14393. This can be confirmed, for example, by 
#    running the following from an elevated PowerShell prompt - this sample output 
#    is from a fully up to date machine as at mid-November 2016:
#
#    >> PS C:\> $(gin).WindowsBuildLabEx
#    >> 14393.447.amd64fre.rs1_release_inmarket.161102-0100
#
# 2. Git for Windows (or another git client) must be installed. https://git-scm.com/download/win.
#
# 3. The machine must be configured to run containers. For example, by following
#    the quick start guidance at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start or
#    https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/windows/windows-containers/Setup.md
#
# 4. If building in a Hyper-V VM: For Windows Server 2016 using Windows Server
#    containers as the default option, it is recommended you have at least 1GB 
#    of memory assigned; For Windows 10 where Hyper-V Containers are employed, you
#    should have at least 4GB of memory assigned. Note also, to run Hyper-V 
#    containers in a VM, it is necessary to configure the VM for nested virtualization.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Usage:
# -----
#
#  The following steps should be run from an (elevated*) Windows PowerShell prompt. 
#
#  (*In a default installation of containers on Windows following the quick-start guidance at
#    https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start,
#    the docker.exe client must run elevated to be able to connect to the daemon).
#
# 1. Clone the sources from github.com:
#
#    >>   git clone https://github.com/docker/docker.git C:\gopath\src\github.com\docker\docker
#    >>   Cloning into 'C:\gopath\src\github.com\docker\docker'...
#    >>   remote: Counting objects: 186216, done.
#    >>   remote: Compressing objects: 100% (21/21), done.
#    >>   remote: Total 186216 (delta 5), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 186195
#    >>   Receiving objects: 100% (186216/186216), 104.32 MiB | 8.18 MiB/s, done.
#    >>   Resolving deltas: 100% (123139/123139), done.
#    >>   Checking connectivity... done.
#    >>   Checking out files: 100% (3912/3912), done.
#    >>   PS C:\>
#
#
# 2. Change directory to the cloned docker sources:
#
#    >>   cd C:\gopath\src\github.com\docker\docker 
#
#
# 3. Build a docker image with the components required to build the docker binaries from source
#    by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows .          
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows -m 2GB .    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 4. Build the docker executable binaries by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   $DOCKER_GITCOMMIT=(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
#    >>   docker run --name binaries -e DOCKER_GITCOMMIT=$DOCKER_GITCOMMIT nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary
#    >>   docker run --name binaries -e DOCKER_GITCOMMIT=$DOCKER_GITCOMMIT -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 5. Copy the binaries out of the container, replacing HostPath with an appropriate destination 
#    folder on the host system where you want the binaries to be located.
#
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\gopath\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\docker.exe C:\HostPath\docker.exe
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\gopath\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\dockerd.exe C:\HostPath\dockerd.exe
#
#
# 6. (Optional) Remove the interim container holding the built executable binaries:
#
#    >>    docker rm binaries
#
#
# 7. (Optional) Remove the image used for the container in which the executable
#    binaries are build. Tip - it may be useful to keep this image around if you need to
#    build multiple times. Then you can take advantage of the builder cache to have an
#    image which has all the components required to build the binaries already installed.
#
#    >>    docker rmi nativebuildimage
#

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  The validation tests can only run directly on the host. This is because they calculate
#  information from the git repo, but the .git directory is not passed into the image as
#  it is excluded via .dockerignore. Run the following from a Windows PowerShell prompt
#  (elevation is not required): (Note Go must be installed to run these tests)
#
#    >>   hack\make.ps1 -DCO -PkgImports -GoFormat


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run unit tests, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then run one of
#  the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run --rm nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -TestUnit
#    >>   docker run --rm -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -TestUnit    (if using Hyper-V containers)


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run unit tests and binary build, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then 
#  run one of the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:

# This file describes the standard way to build Docker in a container on Windows
# Server 2016 or Windows 10.
#
# Maintainer: @jhowardmsft
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Prerequisites:
# --------------
#
# 1. Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10 with all Windows updates applied. The major 
#    build number must be at least 14393. This can be confirmed, for example, by 
#    running the following from an elevated PowerShell prompt - this sample output 
#    is from a fully up to date machine as at mid-November 2016:
#
#    >> PS C:\> $(gin).WindowsBuildLabEx
#    >> 14393.447.amd64fre.rs1_release_inmarket.161102-0100
#
# 2. Git for Windows (or another git client) must be installed. https://git-scm.com/download/win.
#
# 3. The machine must be configured to run containers. For example, by following
#    the quick start guidance at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start or
#    https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/windows/windows-containers/Setup.md
#
# 4. If building in a Hyper-V VM: For Windows Server 2016 using Windows Server
#    containers as the default option, it is recommended you have at least 1GB 
#    of memory assigned; For Windows 10 where Hyper-V Containers are employed, you
#    should have at least 4GB of memory assigned. Note also, to run Hyper-V 
#    containers in a VM, it is necessary to configure the VM for nested virtualization.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Usage:
# -----
#
#  The following steps should be run from an (elevated*) Windows PowerShell prompt. 
#
#  (*In a default installation of containers on Windows following the quick-start guidance at
#    https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start,
#    the docker.exe client must run elevated to be able to connect to the daemon).
#
# 1. Clone the sources from github.com:
#
#    >>   git clone https://github.com/docker/docker.git C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker
#    >>   Cloning into 'C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker'...
#    >>   remote: Counting objects: 186216, done.
#    >>   remote: Compressing objects: 100% (21/21), done.
#    >>   remote: Total 186216 (delta 5), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 186195
#    >>   Receiving objects: 100% (186216/186216), 104.32 MiB | 8.18 MiB/s, done.
#    >>   Resolving deltas: 100% (123139/123139), done.
#    >>   Checking connectivity... done.
#    >>   Checking out files: 100% (3912/3912), done.
#    >>   PS C:\>
#
#
# 2. Change directory to the cloned docker sources:
#
#    >>   cd C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker 
#
#
# 3. Build a docker image with the components required to build the docker binaries from source
#    by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows .          
#    >>   docker build -t nativebuildimage -f Dockerfile.windows -m 2GB .    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 4. Build the docker executable binaries by running one of the following:
#
#    >>   docker run --name binaries nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary
#    >>   docker run --name binaries -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -Binary    (if using Hyper-V containers)
#
#
# 5. Copy the binaries out of the container, replacing HostPath with an appropriate destination 
#    folder on the host system where you want the binaries to be located.
#
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\docker.exe C:\HostPath\docker.exe
#    >>   docker cp binaries:C:\go\src\github.com\docker\docker\bundles\dockerd.exe C:\HostPath\dockerd.exe
#
#
# 6. (Optional) Remove the interim container holding the built executable binaries:
#
#    >>    docker rm binaries
#
#
# 7. (Optional) Remove the image used for the container in which the executable
#    binaries are build. Tip - it may be useful to keep this image around if you need to
#    build multiple times. Then you can take advantage of the builder cache to have an
#    image which has all the components required to build the binaries already installed.
#
#    >>    docker rmi nativebuildimage
#

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  The validation tests can either run in a container, or directly on the host. To run in a
#  container, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then run one of the
#  following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run --rm nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -DCO -PkgImports -GoFormat
#    >>   docker run --rm -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -DCO -PkgImports -GoFormat    (if using Hyper-V containers)

# To run the validation tests on the host, from the root of the repository, run the
# following from a Windows PowerShell prompt (elevation is not required): (Note Go
# must be installed to run these tests)
#
#    >>   hack\make.ps1 -DCO -PkgImports -GoFormat

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run unit tests, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then run one of
#  the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run --rm nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -TestUnit
#    >>   docker run --rm -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -TestUnit    (if using Hyper-V containers)


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#  To run all tests and binary build, ensure you have created the nativebuildimage above. Then 
#  run one of the following from an (elevated) Windows PowerShell prompt:
#
#    >>   docker run nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -All
#    >>   docker run -m 2GB nativebuildimage hack\make.ps1 -All    (if using Hyper-V containers)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Important notes:
# ---------------
#
# Don't attempt to use a bind-mount to pass a local directory as the bundles target
# directory. It does not work (golang attempts for follow a mapped folder incorrectly). 
# Instead, use docker cp as per the example.
#
# go.zip is not removed from the image as it is used by the Windows CI servers
# to ensure the host and image are running consistent versions of go.
#
# Nanoserver support is a work in progress. Although the image will build if the 
# FROM statement is updated, it will not work when running autogen through hack\make.ps1. 
# It is suspected that the required GCC utilities (eg gcc, windres, windmc) silently
# quit due to the use of console hooks which are not available.
#
# The docker integration tests do not currently run in a container on Windows, predominantly
# due to Windows not supporting privileged mode, so anything using a volume would fail.
# They (along with the rest of the docker CI suite) can be run using 
# https://github.com/jhowardmsft/docker-w2wCIScripts/blob/master/runCI/Invoke-DockerCI.ps1.
#

# The number of build steps below are explicitly minimised to improve performance.
